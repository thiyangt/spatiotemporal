# Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

A coordinate reference system (CRS) refers to the way in which spatial data that represent the earth’s surface (which is round / 3 dimensional) are flattened so that you can “Draw” them on a 2-dimensional surface.

# Coordinate system

This system consists of an X and a Y value located within a 2 (or more) - dimensional space.

# Globe to Plane

**What do we want to plot?**

Globe - 3D Space

**Where do we plot?**

Computer screen or paper - 2D Space

To define the location of objects on the Earth, which is round, we need a **coordinate system** that adapts to the Earth’s shape.

# Components of CRS

- Coordinate system: X, Y grid to define a point located in space

- Horizontal and vertical units

# Why multiple CRS?

To optimize to best represent the

- shape and/or

- scale / distance and/or

- area

# Why CRS is important?
